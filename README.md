## Abstract  
1.	Coral recruitment represents a key element for coral reef persistence and resilience in the face of environmental disturbances. Studying coral recruitment patterns is fundamental for assessing reef health and implementing appropriate management strategies in an era of climate change.
2.	In situ fluorescence census techniques have increasingly been used as they make highly cryptic coral recruits much easier and faster to detect than under standard white light census.
3.	The FluorIS system has been developed to acquire high resolution, wide ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) in situ images of coral recruits ﬂuorescence, and it has been shown to be successful in shallow reef environments. However, up to now, its applicability to mesophotic coral ecosystems remains unknown due to the complexity of the system and the limited time available when working at mesophotic depth.
4.	In this study we optimized the FluorIS system by utilizing a single infrared-converted camera instead of the bulkier regular dual-camera system, significantly reducing the system complexity and the time required to complete the underwater survey.
5.	With this faster, more flexible and easier to handle system we surveyed coral recruits under 2 cm in diameter using a 25x25 cm quadrat across shallow and mesophotic reefs of the northern Red Sea and Bermuda. 
6.	Our single-camera system represents a valuable, non-invasive and rapid underwater tool to investigate in situ corals recruitment over a broader range of depths than previous fluorescence methods. Our improved technique significantly increases the speed and accuracy of coral recruits’ count, ultimately allowing us to obtain a deeper understanding of coral early life-history patterns, which is critical for developing suitable reef conservation and management strategies.
